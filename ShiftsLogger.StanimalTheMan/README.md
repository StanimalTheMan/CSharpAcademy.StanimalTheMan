# Shifts Logger Web API Project

## Todo / Future Improvements:
- Give user better feedback depending on status code in HTTP response
- When viewing a specific todo or updating todo, should I make another successful asynchronous API call to fetch all shifts for display? Or is that out of scope
- Use tables to better display shifts?
- I can probably DRY up logic such as POST and PUT handlers
